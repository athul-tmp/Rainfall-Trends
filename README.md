# Project Name: Rainfall Data Quality and Trend Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of a daily rainfall dataset, with an emphasis on data quality and trend analysis. The dataset contains daily rainfall measurements, and the primary objective was to ensure data accuracy and integrity while identifying significant trends in rainfall patterns over multiple years.

## Goals and Objectives
The main goals of this project were to clean and prepare the rainfall dataset, verify its accuracy, and analyze rainfall trends over time. Specific objectives included:

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**: Ensure data integrity by handling missing, impossible, and inconsistent values, and correct data entry errors.
2. **Data Accuracy Verification**: Verify the accuracy of the dataset by checking for correct day counts in each month and manually correcting errors.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Utilize data exploration techniques to analyze rainfall patterns and visualize trends using bar and line graphs.
4. **Insight Generation**: Provide insights into annual and monthly rainfall trends, identifying significant variations between consecutive years.
   
## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**:
- Handled missing, impossible, and inconsistent values to ensure data quality.
- Manually corrected data entry errors and inconsistent formats.
- Verified correct day counts for each month in the dataset.
  
2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:

- Analyzed rainfall patterns across multiple years.
- Visualized maximum, minimum, and mean daily rainfall using bar and line graphs.
- Identified significant variations in annual and monthly rainfall trends.
  
## Conclusion
This project successfully provided meaningful insights into rainfall trends over multiple years. By focusing on data integrity and trend analysis, the project highlighted significant variations in rainfall patterns, which could be useful for further studies or decision-making processes.
